# wave-effect-sign-in-form

I made this project to practice JS, HTML and CSS

description:

there is a sign-in form with two input fields.
One input field has a 'Name' label,
another input field has a 'Password' label.
Labels serve as placeholders, in this case.
After user clicks any of the inputs, the label for that input slides up, as a wave.
Nice!
